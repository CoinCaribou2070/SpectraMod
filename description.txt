Spectra mod is a port of the terraria fan mod "Spectra Mod" to tModLoader.

Original spectra mod items, bosses, and ideas by DiagnosticLord and OreoV2. The original fan wiki can be found here: https://terraria-spectra-mod.fandom.com/wiki/Terraria_Spectra_Mod_Wiki.
Please note that the original spectra mod wiki's information may not be accurate for this port.


I do not claim to have invented any of the original spectra mod ideas, and all bosses, items, buffs, dialogue, mechanics, and names belong to their original creator.
